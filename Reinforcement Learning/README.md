## Introduction

This repo contains impromtou implementations of agents and systems designed using CNTK and ONNX.

**MS-CNTK** The Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (https://cntk.ai), is a unified deep-learning toolkit that allows implementation of neural networks as a series of computational steps via a directed graph where leaf nodes represent input values or network parameters, while other nodes represent matrix operations upon their inputs. 

CNTK allows to easily realize and combine popular model types such as feed-forward DNNs, convolutional nets (CNNs), and recurrent networks (RNNs/LSTMs). It implements stochastic gradient descent (SGD, error backpropagation) learning with automatic differentiation and parallelization across multiple GPUs and servers.

**ONNX** The Open Neural Network Exchange ONNX format is also supported by CNTK, it is an open-source shared model representation for framework interoperability and shared optimization.
